Install a Ubuntu 10.04 server, 32 bit http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ubuntu-cd//lucid/ubuntu-10.04.2-server-i3... with open-ssh server, mail and postgres server as well.

sudo apt-get install curl
bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://raw.github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/master/setup/install)

Change the fowlling in the cloud_controller.yml file:
external_uri to cloudfoundry.myDOMAIN.myTLD
local_route to the ipaddress of the server
allow_external_app_uris to true
allow_external to true
reserved_list was uncommented
admins was changed
default_account_capacity was changed

bin/vcap start
vmc target cloudfoundry.myDOMAIN.myTLD
vmc register myEmail - The same i wrote in the cloud_controller.yml for admins.

Entered my password twice

Change the fowlling in the cloud_controller.yml file:
local_register_only to true

bin/vcap restart

It is not possible to register anymore, except for admins can create new accounts.

CloudFoundry work.

Then i want to use the production configuration:
Change the fowlling in the cloud_controller.yml file:
rails_environment to production
adapter to postgresql
and the username and password.
added staging_cache: /var/vcap.local/staging

Installed pg gem and thats it.
